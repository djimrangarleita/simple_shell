# 0 x 16. C - Simple Shell

## *Overview*

This is a custom implementation of a UNIX shell alias simple shell, its a requirement to be completed in the first sprint in the ALX school SE program. A shell is basically a command-line interpretor for Linux. It acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. It facilitates execution of different commands. 

## *Requirements*

### *General*
 
1. Allowed editors: vim, vi,emacs.
2. All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options * -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89*
3. Betty coding standards

### *Fetaures*
In our simple shell we tried to incoporate significant functions so as tohave as to ensure that the shell functionality is as smooth as possible. These functions are the following;

. *access:* This function checks user permission for execetuing files. 
. *execve:* It executes programs that are specified by the user.
. *exit:*   Exits the shell
. *fork:*  Creates child parent processes for command execetuion.
. *perror:* Displays the error message.
. *stat:* Gets information about files.
. *wait:* Suspending execution until a child process is complete.
. *strtok:*
. *execres:*

### *Usage example.*

To explain the simple shell usage and functionality, I want you to consider this scenario:when a user enters 'pwd' the shellinterprets and executes the 'pwd' command, this will ensure the user interracts with the system seamlessly.

### *How to Run*

To run the simple_shell,follow the steps below:

1.Clone the repository into your local machine.
2.Compile the program using a C compiler(e.g., gcc)
3.Execute the compiled binary.

	*$ gcc -o simple shell *.c*
	*$ ./simple shell*

I think now you have a basic idea of how our simple shell works. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to the project ocontributors. Happy coding!
